#  NLP for Customer Support Automation

This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to categorize customer 
support tickets and enhance response automation. The main goal is to improve support efficiency, reduce resolution 
time, and boost customer satisfaction.

---

## Project Overview

Customer support teams receive thousands of tickets daily. Manual triage leads to delays and inefficiencies. 
This project leverages **text classification** using NLP and ML models to:

- Automatically classify support tickets into categories.
- Understand common issues using ticket descriptions.
- Help build an automated response system.

---

##  Objectives

-  Develop an NLP model for automated ticket classification.
-  Categorize customer inquiries into meaningful topics.
-  Achieve classification accuracy of **at least 85%**.
-  Reduce response time for frequent issues by **20%**.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Scikit-learn**
- **TfidfVectorizer**
- **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, **Naive Bayes**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
